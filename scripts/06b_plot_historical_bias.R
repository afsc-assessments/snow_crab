## 06b_plot_historical_bias.R
##
## Compares estimated mature male biomass across ASSESSMENT VINTAGES -- the
## 2016, 2017, ... 2025 assessments' views of the same historical years.
##
## This is NOT the model retrospective (that is 06_run_retrospective.R, which
## peels data off one model). It reads previously-published time series from
## data/historical/ and shows how successive assessments have revised history.
## The two analyses answer different questions and were previously tangled in
## one file; this script is the historical block lifted out of the old
## 06_run_retrospective.R (lines 422-466) with its missing patchwork dependency
## supplied.
##
## Usage (from the snow_sept repo root):
##   Rscript 06b_plot_historical_bias.R
##
## Output: plots/historical_mating_mmb_est.png
##
## NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED BY THE SAFE (checked 2026-08-27). 2026_snowcrab_safe_draft.Rmd
## has no reference to this figure, so the script runs and the PNG is written
## but nothing consumes it. The previous header cited "the 2025 reference Rmd,
## line 2631"; there is no Rmd in Reports/, only the published PDFs, so that
## citation could not be checked and has been removed rather than carried
## forward. Add an include chunk to the Rmd, or accept this as a standalone
## diagnostic -- but do not assume it reaches the document.
##
## WHAT THE FIGURE SHOWS, and why the panels end in different years: the survey
## series runs through each assessment's own year, the mating series through the
## year before it (mature biomass at mating needs the following season), so
## panel 1's lines extend one year past panel 2's for the same vintage. That is
## the convention in the source files, not a gap.
##
## The 2020 vintage is the point of the whole figure: it put terminal biomass at
## 486.5, and the 2021 assessment revised that same year to 40.95 -- a 92%
## downward revision, the collapse arriving in the historical record.
