#
# THE SEPTEMBER 2026 SET. Pruned 2026-08-28 from the 14-model May candidate
# bracket to the six models this cycle actually runs. The May bracket is not
# lost -- it lives in the May repo's own 0-models.R (../snow_crab/0-models.R)
# and in this file's git history.
#
# Pruning was gated on the audit the old port note called for ("audit every
# model_defs[N] use in the Rmd"). That audit was done before pruning and found
# NO positional indexing anywhere: every reference to model_defs/model_shorts is
# by name (report_model <- model_defs[accepted_model]), by loop, or whole-vector,
# and the results object is likewise keyed by case name
# (reslst$repsLst[[accepted_model]]), never by position. The one "model_defs[1]"
# in the Rmd is a comment recording a reference that had already been removed.
#
# MODEL NUMBERING (Grant, 2026-08-29). The shortnames below are what the report
# shows; the long labels are internal case keys only and still carry the earlier
# "25.1/26.1 gmacs (...)" wording -- that is cosmetic and deliberately NOT
# churned, because those strings are the join key across 0-models.R,
# 03_build_results_object.R and the Rmd's accepted_model selector.
#
# RENUMBERED to 26.x on 2026-08-29, following the May 2026 CPT report:
# "The base model brought forward was model 25.3 (which was mistakenly labeled
# as model 25 in the proposed model document and presentation)" and "Numbers for
# new models that were brought forward at this meeting were mistakenly labeled
# as corresponding to 2025 rather than 2026, and this will be corrected for the
# September CPT meeting." The September 2025 CPT report says the same of the
# 2025 document ("mistakenly labeled as model 25.1"). The previous scheme here
# (Model 25 / 25.2c / 25.2e / 25.2e (new data) / 25.2e (2019 data) / 26.1) was
# the labelling the CPT identified as mistaken.
#
# The scheme follows the review checklist: "Model yy.j" for a major change,
# "Model yy.jx" for a minor one, where yy is the year. A run that only changes
# the data is minor and takes a letter; a change to the model itself takes a new
# integer.
#   Model 25.3   the September 2025 accepted assessment, rolled forward. Its
#                correct number per both CPT reports; GMACS 2.20.22.
#   Model 26.1   the configuration accepted by the CPT in May 2026 -- GMACS
#                2.20.34, total-male composition corrected, plus group expanded,
#                new maturity workflow. Terminal 2024. The step-change baseline.
#   Model 26.1a  as 26.1 with the binning convention (right = FALSE) and the
#                growth transcription error corrected. Terminal 2024. Data
#                corrections only, hence a letter.
#   Model 26.1b  the RECOMMENDED model -- 26.1a advanced to end year 2025
#                (fishery through 2025, survey through 2026). Data only.
#   Model 26.1c  26.1b truncated to 2019, the May 2026 CPT diagnostic request.
#                Data only.
#   Model 26.2   male-only sensitivity, requested by the May 2026 CPT. Structural
#                -- nsex = 1 removes the female population, parameters and data
#                (412 -> 234 estimated parameters) -- so a new integer rather
#                than a letter. Not proposed for specification unless the CPT
#                selects it.
#
# CROSS-VALIDATION AGAINST THE SSC. The checklist also requires model numbers to
# match those the SSC endorsed, and the June 2026 SSC report refers to the
# accepted configuration as "Model 25.2c". That is Model 26.1 here. The mapping
# from the May 2026 numbering is therefore stated explicitly in Section E of the
# report, and it is:
#   25.3 -> 25.3 | 25.2c -> 26.1 | 25.2e -> 26.1a
#   25.2e (new data) -> 26.1b | 25.2e (2019 data) -> 26.1c | 26.1 (male-only) -> 26.2

#-- Convergence experiments (2026-08-30, per Grant) ------------------------
# DELIBERATELY NOT IN model_defs. These three were built to diagnose the 26
# model's multimodality, not to be assessment candidates, and they must not
# enter the model-comparison tables. The reason is that their objective
# functions are not the same function:
#
#   26.d1 stability   forked TPL (GMACS_tpl-cpp_code_recprop_sd1): the sex-ratio
#                     penalty sd is hardcoded, changed 2.0 -> 1.0
#   26.d2 initscaled  stock binary, but initial conditions mode 2 -> 3
#                     (FREEPARSSCALED) drops the reference class and rescales
#   26.d3 eqmdevs     forked TPL (GMACS_tpl-cpp_code_eqmdevs): adds
#                     nlogPenalty(5), a term that does not exist in 2.20.34
#
# So a likelihood comparison against the six above is meaningless: eqmdevs
# reports nll -23886.01 against the accepted model's -23546.35 while its DATA
# component (catch + index + size + stock-recruit + tagging + growth) is 36 units
# WORSE. Only within-model convergence statistics -- how
# often a model recovers its own best optimum -- are comparable across this set,
# and that is all the convergence appendix reports.
#
# The shared tree GMACs/GMACS_tpl-cpp_code is byte-unchanged (md5
# b5392eea9d2956816b36acbae7c2c317), asserted at every build.
