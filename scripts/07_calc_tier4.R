## TERMINAL-YEAR KNOBS: SURVEY_YEARS, BMSY_WINDOW_END (both Section 1)
##
## OFL BASIS (settled 2026-08-28; backlog 7d, 7e). Two independent choices, both
## switchable at the top of Section 1, with all four combinations reported:
##   HCR_RAMP = TRUE   the crab FMP Tier 4 control rule: F_OFL ramps linearly
##                     from 0 at beta to M at the BMSY proxy,
##                     F_OFL = M (status - alpha)/(1 - alpha). This is the FMP
##                     form and is what the October 2025 SSC specified for this
##                     stock (F_OFL 0.19, OFL 20.11 kt). The flat rule is
##                     retained in the OFL_flat_* columns (OFL_linear and
##                     OFL_baranov are back-compat aliases for the flat-rule
##                     results).
##   OFL_EQN  = baranov  the author recommendation as of 2026-08-29. F_OFL is an
##                     instantaneous rate and M acts over the same year, so the
##                     yield is F's share of Z = F + M. The linear form F*B is
##                     reported alongside as OFL_linear.
## Morphometric, 2026: reported (ramp, Baranov) 18.449 / flat+Baranov 23.772 /
## flat+linear 30.765 / ramp+linear 23.158 kt. (Ramp figures changed 2026-08-29 when
## BMSY_WINDOW_END was widened to the full 1982-2026 series; neither flat-F
## figure depends on it.)
##
## Basis (Grant, 2026-08-30, superseding the flat rule decided earlier the same
## day): the RAMPED crab FMP Tier 4 control rule with the Baranov catch equation,
## and a 20% ABC buffer. This is the FMP form, and it is what the October 2025
## SSC specified for this stock after finding that flat M x B was not a full
## Tier 4 implementation.
## Historical note, so it is not reinstated: the flat rule was previously
## justified by citing the groundfish Tier 5 FMP. That was a category error --
## the crab and groundfish FMPs are separate tier systems, so a groundfish
## citation is never available to a crab stock, whichever rule is chosen.

## Converting F_OFL to a catch (backlog 7e, settled 2026-08-28).
##
## REPORTED (2026-08-29): Baranov. Until that date the linear form was reported,
## for consistency with how other BSAI crab Tier 4 assessments compute it; that
## comparability is preserved by the OFL_linear column, which is always written.
##
## Why Baranov is the recommendation: F_OFL
## is an INSTANTANEOUS rate (yr^-1, the same scale as M, which is why Tier 4 can
## set F_OFL = M), and natural mortality acts over the same year, so the yield is
## F's share of total mortality Z = F + M. F*B is only the first-order
## approximation to that and always overstates the catch: at flat F = M it gives
## 30.765 kt against Baranov's 23.772 kt. The gap is at its widest precisely
## here, because F_OFL = M means fishing is exactly half of Z.
##
## Both are computed every run and reported side by side; OFL_EQN selects which
## one populates the reported `OFL` column. F = 0 (closure) returns 0 in both.
## NB both are called with a SCALAR fofl and a VECTOR biomass (Section 4 passes
## a whole survey series). ifelse() returns a result the length of its TEST, so
## ifelse(fofl <= 0, ...) with a scalar fofl silently returns length 1 and the
## series collapses -- that is a real bug this code shipped with for one run on
## 2026-08-28 (Section 4's data.frame failed with "differing number of rows:
## 132, 89", i.e. 1 + 44 + 44). Mask after the arithmetic instead, which
## recycles correctly whether fofl is scalar or a vector.
